# Python Daily Learning
This repository is a personal log of my daily Python review. I already have experience with Python, but Iâ€™m going through the Zero to Mastery Python Course to refresh my knowledge and reinforce key concepts.

## How it works
- I watch a short lesson from the course.
- I take notes and write simple code snippets to reinforce the concept.
- I upload the content daily to track my progress.

## What to expect
This is an ongoing project where I document my learning journey. The repository will gradually cover both basic and advanced Python concepts.
