"""
A Class Object Attribute (also called a Class Attribute) is a variable that is shared across all instances of a class.
It is defined directly inside the class, outside any methods, unlike instance attributes which are specific to each object.

Feature                   | Class Attribute                         | Instance Attribute
--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------
Defined in                | Inside the class, outside methods       | Inside the __init__ method
Scope                     | Shared by all instances                 | Unique to each instance
Can be modified?          | Yes, but changes affect all instances   | Yes, but only for that instance

# When to Use Class Attributes? ü§î
# For values shared among all instances, like default configurations.
# To count instances of a class, useful in patterns like Singleton.
