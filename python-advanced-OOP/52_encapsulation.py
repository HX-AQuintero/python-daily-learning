# Encapsulation
"""
This means binding of data and functions that manipulate that data.
Encapsulation in OOP means grouping related data (attributes) and
behaviors (methods) inside a class, so that objects (instances) manage
their own state and behavior.

car2.brake(50)
print(car2.show_info()) # Ford Mustang is running at 20 km/h.

# Why is this Encapsulation? ðŸ¤”
# - Data (attributes) and behavior (methods) are inside the class.
# - Objects (car1, car2) manage their own state independently.
# - Methods control how attributes are changed (e.g., accelerate, brake).

"""
Encapsulation ensures that each object is responsible
for its own behavior, keeping the code organized and modular.
