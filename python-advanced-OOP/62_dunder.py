# Dunder methods
"""
(Short for double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that begin and end with double
undercores (__method__).
They enable objects to work with built-in operations like addition (+), length (len()), iteration,
string representation, and more.

"""
- If there is a __str__ dunder method, str() calls it, if not, calls __repr__.
If this latter is missing, the result will be a not user-friendly output. It's
a good practices to define one of them.
- If there is a __len__ dunder method, len() calls it, if not, raise an error
(TypeError: object of type 'Toy' has no len())
- __call__ makes the object callable.
- Python automatically calls __del__ when an object has no more references, meaning
nothing in the program is using it.
- The __getitem__() method allows objects to support indexing like lists.
