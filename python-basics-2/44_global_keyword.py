"""
We need to explicitly tell that total is a global variable to get access to it.
The global total statement tells Python to use the total variable from the global
scope instead of creating a new local variable.

"""
Instead of modifying a global variable directly, a better practice is to pass total
as a parameter and return the updated value.

- This avoids modifying global state inside a function (which is generally considered bad practice).
- The function works independently without needing global variables.
- It makes debugging and testing easier.
